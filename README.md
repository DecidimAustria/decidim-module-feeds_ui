# Decidim::FeedsUi

A mobile ui for the decidim feeds module.

## Usage

FeedsUi will add an overview over all users under /feeds_ui/allusers

It will also overwrite the decidim layout for a more minimalistic and mobile first interface that is optimal for the [feeds](https://github.com/DecidimAustria/decidim-module-feeds) and [posts](https://github.com/DecidimAustria/decidim-module-posts) modules.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem "decidim-feeds_ui"
```

And then execute:

```bash
bundle
```
